## MobiFlex Mobile UI Un-framework

Right at this moment, we have a lot of mobile UI frameworks that are hitting the mobile scene and while a lot of them are very good, they do carry a bit of extra weight in a world where 'being light' is very important.  MobiFlex is a response to that and delivers just the core elements of what is required to build a cross-device mobile application.

### Requirements

While it won't be to everybody's tastes, MobiFlex requires either [jQuery](http://jquery.com) or [zepto](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) for the Javascript it writes.  I'm not sorry.

### It's a start

There will definitely be room for improvement in what is presented here.  There will be opportunities to replace javascript with pure CSS implementations, etc, and please if you have skills in that area - feel free to fork mobiflex and I'll happily merge improvements back in.
